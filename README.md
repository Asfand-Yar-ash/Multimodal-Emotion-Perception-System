# Multimodal-Emotion-Perception-System
A modular real time system for detecting human emotions from facial expressions, speech audio, and body or hand gestures using pretrained deep learning models. Designed for on device inference with minimal latency, the outputs are intended for integration into higher level rule based or symbolic reasoning systems.
